I'm releasing the source code for this project since I've gotten quite a 
bit of email with really good suggestions on how to make this better,
but I don't have the time to implement them myself.

The code (/src/) is released as public domain, so you can do with it
what you wish. The art (/res/) is still copyright nintendo, so it's
almost certainly NOT ok to do anything at all with it. Ask nintendo.

And, please, if you're going to make a bigger project out of this, please
consider replacing the art with legal art.
