 this is the original source code that was later taken and modified
 by Chris Lewis for the Mario AI competition allowing it to run on Macs.
License: public-domain
 The code (/src/) is released as public domain, so you can do with it
 what you wish. The art (/res/) is still copyright nintendo, so it's
 almost certainly NOT ok to do anything at all with it. Ask nintendo.

 Infinite Mario Bros. is the source used for infintetux.
 The code was "mavenized" by Chris Lewis. the "com" directory was moved
 and the assets directory was moved and renamed to from "res" to
 "resources". The structure is now "src/main/java/com" instead of
 "src/com" The assets are now in "src/main/resources"

Comment: The listed files are all located in src/main/resources
 These are the original filenames used when Infinte Mario Bros. was 
 created. The names were kept and the sprites drawn in the same pixel
 positions in order not to modify the games source code. Part of the 
 reason for this is to be able to take Infinite Mario Bros. variants
 and legalize them by replacing the Nintendo assets with these.

 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 .
 Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
 intended for use by those authorized to give the public
 permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
 copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
 irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
 and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
 Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
 applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
 material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
 material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
 licensed material, or material used under an exception or
 limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
 wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 .
 Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
 licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
 licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
 the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
 example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
 copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
 licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
 other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
 the licensed material may still be restricted for other
 reasons, including because others have copyright or other
 rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
 such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
 Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
 respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations

 According to opengameart
 OGA-BY 3.0 explicitly allows content to be relicensed under CC-BY 3.0.
 Just change the license to CC-BY 3.0.  No need to get explicit
 permission to do this, as the license already allows it.

Comment: 1-up.wav replaced with fire-flower.wav from the supertux

 it's o.k. because supertux is already in debian.

 There is a line that states the folloeing.
 "All files in data/music created by wansti and licensed under
 GPLv2+CC-by-sa, unless stated otherwise". wantsi is the same author for
 jump.wav so I'm hoping this applies as well.
